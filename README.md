# Retirement

As of **June 2020** this repository is put in read only mode (archived).
Translated decided to close the sources of the **MateCat Filters** project.
The source herein corresponds to version _1.2.5_ based on Okapi version _M36_.

The MateCat Filters will still be usable via the [hosted API](https://rapidapi.com/translated/api/matecat-filters/). A [basic free plan](https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/api-pricing) will allow trial and testing.


## Convert any file to XLIFF and back

With **MateCat Filters** you can easily extract all the translatable contents from any file format into a convenient XLIFF file.

After you have translated your XLIFF, use Filters again to get back a completely translated file in the original format, with perfectly preserved formatting.

Fast, reliable and scalable, running everyday inside [MateCat](https://www.matecat.com/), the popular open-source CAT tool.

Test it right now on [matecat.com](https://www.matecat.com/): when you upload your file and later download it translated, 
you are using Filters.


## Main features

#### Plenty of supported formats
Among others, MateCat Filters fully supports Microsoft Office formats (legacy ones too), Open Office, PDF, hypertext, and even images of scanned documents thanks to automatic OCR (using the proper external library). See the [full list](https://github.com/matecat/MateCat-Filters/wiki/Supported-file-formats) in the Wiki.

#### Advanced segmentation
Filters uses segmentation rules defined by the Unicode consortium, plus another set of rules specifically designed for CAT Tools. This is why Filters can properly split sentences even in uncommon languages like Mongolian.

#### Hosted API
- **Istantly ready to use**, zero installation / configuration.
- **Runs in MateCat's infrastructure**, with instances constantly monitored, optimized, and updated.
- **Transparent versioning**: automatically downgrades when you try to convert a XLIFF created with an older version of MateCat Filters.
- **Commercial dependencies included**: you don't need to buy licenses for the commercial software MateCat Filter uses to support OCR, PDF and legacy MS Office formats.
